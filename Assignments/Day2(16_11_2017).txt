For the below mentioned assignments write down the commands to achieve the final output

1. Create a directory structure as shown below

	/home/student
		-> C_Programming
				-> Day 1
					-> Assignments
						->Program1.c
						->Program2.c
				-> Day 2
					-> Assignments
						->Program1.c
						->Program2.c
					-> Notes
						->Day2Notes.txt

Answer:	

	//Create Directories First
	mkdir  -p  C_Programming/Day\ 1/Assignments && mkdir -p C_Programming/Day\ 2/Assignments && mkdir -p C_Programming/Day\ 2/Notes
	//Create files under Day 1/Assignments
	cd C_Programming/Day\ 1/Assignments && touch Program1.c Program2.c

	//Create files under Day 2/Assignments
	cd C_Programming/Day\ 2/Assignments && touch Program1.c Program2.c
	
	//Create files under Day2
	cd C_Programming/Day\ 2/Notes && touch Day2Notes.txt


					
2. Create a directory structure /home/student/Day5/Assignment1/Coding where Day5, Assignment1 and Coding are not existing with a single mkdir command
	
Answer:

	mkdir -p  /home/student/Day5/Assignment1/coding	
	


3. Make a copy of the directory structure mentioned in point 1  to a new directory called Programming, How to use cp command for copying directories?

Answer:

	//recursively copy the content from source to dest
	cp -r C_Programming Programming	


4. Remove Day2Notes.txt from the above copied directory

Answer:

	rm Programming/Day\ 2/Notes/Day2Notes.txt

5. List down at least one more command line argument for following commands and give examples and brief explanation about what the argument does
	-> ls
	-> cp
	-> mkdir
	-> mv

Answer:
	
	//prints the current directories list where size of file is in human readable format
	name:~$ls -lh
	
	//copies all the content of the source directories into the destination directories recursively
	name:~$cp -r sourcedir destdir
	
	//creats a parent directory as needed
	name:~$mkdir -p first_dir/second_dir/third_dir

	//move the file by explaining what is being done 
	name:~$mkdir mv -v source_file ../dest_file
